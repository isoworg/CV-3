##Zhivko Siderov

I am an avid bridge player and an enthusiastic junior developer who likes building applications with intuitive user stories, encapsulated code and comprehensive testing. I successfully completed <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com" target="_blank">Makers Academy</a>, a 12 week intensive coding bootcamp, on 13 November 2015.

I am currently looking for a role as a junior developer at an organization that cares about clean-code, testing, teamwork and building great software.

##Skills

####Software Development
My time at Makers Academy consisted of pair-programming and learning about best practices during the week, and working on real-world challenges in the weekend. Below is a snapshot of some of the projects I worked on while I was at Makers Academy:

* <a href="https://github.com/zsid/chitter-challenge" target="_blank">Chitter</a>: A twitter clone built with Ruby and Sinatra, and tested with Rspec and Capybara.

* <a href="https://github.com/zsid/todo_challenge" target="_blank">To do</a>: To do list application built in AngularJS and tested with Karma and Protractor.

* <a href="https://github.com/zsid/instagram-challenge" target="_blank">Instagram</a>: A clone of Instagram built using Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Rspec and Capybara.

* I have also strengthened my personal learning and development by <a href="http://zsid.github.io" target="_blank">blogging</a> about my journey at Makers Academy.

####Responsive learner

I learn from my mistakes. In my previous role I was keen to take on business-facing work early on but I was not practised in truly effective communication - making the purpose and the follow-up actions crystal clear. After taking feedback on this, I attended a course to improve my communication skills and got more responsibility by becoming the first point of contact for inquiries. I love being able to learn from those above me and I take feedback well.

##Volunteer Work
I really love the idea of open source software where everyone has a common goal - to contribute and give back to the community. In my previous role, binding contracts and non-disclosure agreements were the status quo and it is really great to see that the technology industry is a place where sharing and giving back are seen as virtues rather than blockers.
