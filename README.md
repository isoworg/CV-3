##Zhivko Siderov

I am an avid bridge player and an enthusiastic junior developer who likes building applications with intuitive user stories, encapsulated code and comprehensive testing. I successfully completed <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com" target="_blank">Makers Academy</a>, a 12 week intensive coding bootcamp, in November 2015.

I am currently looking for a role as a junior developer at an organization that cares about clean-code, testing, teamwork and building great software.

##Volunteer Work
I really love the idea of open source software where everyone has a common goal - to contribute and give back to the community. In my previous role, binding contracts and non-disclosure agreements were the status quo and it is really great to see that the technology industry is a place where sharing and giving back are seen as virtues rather than blockers.
