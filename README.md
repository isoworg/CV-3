##Zhivko Siderov

I am an avid bridge player and an enthusiastic Junior Developer who likes building applications with intuitive user stories, encapsulated code and comprehensive testing. I successfully completed [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), a 12 week intensive coding bootcamp, on 13 November 2015.

I am currently looking for a role as a junior developer at an organization that cares about clean-code, testing, team-work and building great software.

##Skills

####Software Development
My time at Makers Academy consisted of pair-programming and learning about best practices during the week, and working on real-world challenges in the weekend. Below is a snapshot of some of the projects that I worked on while I was at Makers Academy:

* [Chitter](https://github.com/zsid/chitter-challenge): it is an app that clones features of twitter. Built with Ruby and Sinatra, and tested with Rspec and Capybara.

* [To do](https://github.com/zsid/todo_challenge): To do list application built in AngularJS and tested with Karma and Protractor.

* [Instagram](https://github.com/zsid/instagram-challenge): a clone of Instagram built using Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Rspec and Capybara.

* I have also strengthened my personal learning and development by [blogging](http://zsid.github.io) about my journey at Makers Academy.

####Responsive learner

I learn from my mistakes. In my previous role I was keen to take on business-facing work early on, but I was not practiced in truly effective communication - making the purpose and the follow-up actions crystal clear. After taking feedback on this, I attended a course on communication skills and got more responsibility for being the first point of contact for inquiries. I love being able to learn from those above me and I take feedback well.
